## updatePhone
Update the currently logged in user&#039;s phone number. After updating the phone number, the phone verification status will be reset. A confirmation SMS is not sent automatically, however you can use the [POST /account/verification/phone](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#createPhoneVerification) endpoint to send a confirmation SMS.

### Usage Example

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready():
    # You can skip setup if you have .env
    Appwrite.set_endpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1') # Your API Endpoint
    Appwrite.set_project('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>') # Your project ID
    Appwrite.set_session('') # The user session to authenticate with

    var result = await Appwrite.account.update_phone(
        '+12065550100',
        'password'
    )

    if result is AppwriteException:
        push_error(result.message)
    
    if result is AppwriteUser:
        print(result.to_dict())
