Get usage metrics and statistics a specific bucket in the project. You can view the total number of files, storage usage. The response includes both current totals and historical data over time. Use the optional range parameter to specify the time window for historical data: 24h (last 24 hours), 30d (last 30 days), or 90d (last 90 days). If not specified, range defaults to 30 days.

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready():
    # You can skip setup if you have .env
    Appwrite.set_endpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1') # Your API Endpoint
    Appwrite.set_project('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>') # Your project ID

    var result = await Appwrite.storage.get_bucket_usage(
        '<BUCKET_ID>',
        '24h' # optional
    )

    if result is AppwriteException:
        push_error(result.message)
    
    if result is AppwriteUsageBuckets:
        print(result.to_dict())
